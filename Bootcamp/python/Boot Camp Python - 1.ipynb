    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. It was designed to be easy to learn and use while supporting sophisticated programming techniques and good performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an *interpreted* language a program, here the Python interpreter, reads Python code from a file or from a command line and executes the code. This is contrasted with *compiled* languages (ex. C++, Fortran) where a program, called the compiler, converts program code from a file into executable code which is then run directly by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook provides an interface to the Python interpreter in a highly interactive and easy to modify environment. Program code, comments, descriptive text like this section, plots, and calculation results can all be stored in the notebook. The Python code written in a notebook can be extracted into a regular text file to bring to a different development environment if desired.  You can read more about Project Jupyter here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter system a web server runs a Python interpreter and passes code and results back and forth between your browser and Python.  This allows for the Python process to run on a different computer than your browser.  In the SCC OnDemand system Python runs on a compute server with significantly more memory, disk space, and CPU capability than a typical desktop or laptop.  A notebook can be developed on your personal computer on a small dataset and then moved to a remote system to process a potentially very large dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab is an updated Jupyter Notebook interface. It provides some extra features such as a file browser that make it easier to work with multiple notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks actually run a variant of the standard Python interpreter.  This is called IPython.  It adds a number of features to the Python interpreter that make it easier to use and much easier to integrate into a system like Jupyter.  It does not add to or alter the Python language in any way."

    "\n",

    "* Code cells are for Python code. When code cells are run they execute Python code. If the last line of code returns a value it will be printed automatically.\n",
