### R Track: Part 3 - Data Visualization in R

Examining complex patterns and correlations in data requires visualization to present the results in a digestible form. 
Part Three presents various ways to plot and visualize data. 
Different plotting techniques and formats are presented, along with various ways to format and configure their display and appearance.

R plotting libraries are designed to produce high-quality graphics.

Various types of plots allow to generate plots of:

- a single variable
- two variables
- multiple variables
- networks
- time series
- many other special plots


In this workshop you will learn how to use plots for data exploration. We will also cover how to use R graphics to communicate your results.
