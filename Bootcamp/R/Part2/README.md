### R Track: Part 2 - Data Processing and Handling

To work with a dataset various operations are needed to bring it to a usable state within a program. Part Two walks through this process, covering reading in data from files; cleaning the data; formatting the data; and manipulating the data in memory.

This session will teach you how to explore your data in a systematic way. By the end of it you will learn how to:

- ready, tidy, subset, and transform your dataset
- learn about patterns within your dataset and ask appropriate questions about your data
- how to build your workflow in the most orginized and efficient way
