# Research Computing Bootcamp
## R Track

This Bootcamp will teach you how to analyze a dataset using R programming language.
By the end of R track you will know how to :

- Import your data into R
- Clean (tidy) data
- Transform Data
- Explore the data using visualization tools
- Run basic statistical analysis
- Communicate results


Throughout the Bootcamp we will be using Rstudio.

#### Part 1: Introduction to R
Analyzing a large or complex set of data requires computational techniques implemented in a programming language. Part One introduces R language basics and useful features. Concepts like data types, structures, and syntax are introduced. An example dataset is introduced that will be used throughout all parts.


#### Part 2: Data Processing

To work with a dataset various operations are needed to bring it to a usable state within a program. Part Two walks through this process, covering reading in data from files; cleaning the data; formatting the data; and manipulating the data in memory.

This session will teach you how to explore your data in a systematic way. By the end of it you will learn how to:

- ready, tidy, subset, and transform your dataset
- learn about patterns within your dataset and ask appropriate questions about your data
- how to build your workflow in the most orginized and efficient way



#### Part 3: Data Visualization


#### Statistical Tools for Data Analysis
