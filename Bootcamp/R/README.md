# Research Computing Bootcamp
## R Track

This Bootcamp will teach you how to analyze a dataset using R programming language.
By the end of R track you will know how to :

- Import your data into R
- Clean (tidy) data
- Transform Data
- Explore the data using visualization tools
- Run basic statistical analysis
- Communicate results


Throughout the Bootcamp we will be using Rstudio.

#### Part 1: Introduction to R
Analyzing a large or complex set of data requires computational techniques implemented in a programming language. Part One introduces R language basics and useful features. Concepts like data types, structures, and syntax are introduced. An example dataset is introduced that will be used throughout all parts.


#### Part 2: Data Processing

To work with a dataset various operations are needed to bring it to a usable state within a program. Part Two walks through this process, covering reading in data from files; cleaning the data; formatting the data; and manipulating the data in memory.

This session will teach you how to explore your data in a systematic way. By the end of it you will learn how to:

- ready, tidy, subset, and transform your dataset
- learn about patterns within your dataset and ask appropriate questions about your data
- how to build your workflow in the most orginized and efficient way



#### Part 3: Data Visualization

Examining complex patterns and correlations in data requires visualization to present the results in a digestible form. Part Three presents various ways to plot and visualize data. Different plotting techniques and formats are presented, along with various ways to format and configure their display and appearance.

R plotting libraries are designed to produce high-quality graphics.

Various types of plots allow to generate plots of:

- a single variable
- two variables
- multiple variables
- networks
- time series
- many other special plots

In this workshop you will learn how to use plots for data exploration. We will also cover how to use R graphics to communicate your results.


#### Statistical Tools for Data Analysis

Discovering and verifying meaningful patterns and correlations in data requires quantitative techniques that can analyze the data in a rigorous mathematical or algorithmic way. Part Four presents how to use various basic statistical tools to analyze the example dataset. The use of these tools is demonstrated and various example diagnostics, patterns, and correlations are examined in the example dataset.
